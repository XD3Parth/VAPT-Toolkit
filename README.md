## 🚀 Overview

**XD3Parth VAPT Toolkit** is a comprehensive Python-based security suite that merges both **offensive** and **defensive** tools for full-spectrum penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Everything you need in one CLI toolkit — fast, lightweight, modular.

---

## 🧰 Features

### 🔧 Offensive Modules
- **Port Scanner**  
  Scan for open ports, services, and banners across IPv4 targets.

- **Web Crawler**  
  Automatically crawls websites and extracts URLs, forms, and endpoints.

- **Footprinting & Reconnaissance**  
  Perform WHOIS lookups, DNS info, IP geolocation, headers, and metadata extraction.

- **Web Pentester**  
  Check websites for common web app vulnerabilities like:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Local File Inclusion (LFI)
  - Remote File Inclusion (RFI)
  - Header Injection, etc.

---

### 🔐 Encryption & Hashing Tools
- **Hash Generator**  
  Generate hashes using MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 algorithms.

- **Custom Encryption**  
  Built-in proprietary lightweight cipher for secured local data protection.

- **Advanced Encryption / Decryption**  
  AES (256-bit), RSA encryption, base64 encoding, and file encryption using strong keys.

---

### 🖼️ Steganography Module
- **Hide Messages**  
  Embed secret text or files inside images (PNG/JPG).

- **Extract Hidden Data**  
  Extract concealed data from images using simple CLI.

---

### 🔑 Password Tools
- **Password Generator**  
  Generate complex, random, and strong passwords based on rules.

- **Password Strength Meter**  
  Checks entropy, length, character set variety, and known breaches to rate password strength.

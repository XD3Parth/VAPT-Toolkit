# Web Pentester

**Web Pentester** is an advanced web penetration testing tool designed to help security professionals and ethical hackers perform various security tests on web applications or websites. It supports common vulnerability tests like **XSS**, **SQL Injection**, **SSL/TLS Checks**, **Security Header Verification**, **Broken Authentication**, **Directory Scanning**, and more. The tool includes features like **multithreading** to speed up tests and a user-friendly **GUI** built with **Tkinter**.

## Features

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Testing**: Tests forms for XSS vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Detects SQL injection vulnerabilities in web forms.
- **SSL/TLS Validation**: Checks the validity of SSL/TLS certificates.
- **Security Headers Check**: Validates the presence of essential HTTP security headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, etc.
- **Broken Authentication Detection**: Tests for weak or broken login authentication mechanisms.
- **Directory Scanning**: Scans for common sensitive files and directories like `robots.txt`, `.git`, `.env`, etc.
- **Open Ports Scan**: Scans for open ports on the target domain.
- **Multithreading**: Speeds up testing by running tasks concurrently.
- **Export Results**: Saves the testing results to a text file.
- **GUI Interface**: A user-friendly interface built with **Tkinter**.

## To Be Added Features

- **Advanced Bruteforce Attack**: Implement stronger bruteforce techniques for login page testing, supporting wordlist-based attacks.
- **Subdomain Enumeration**: Add a feature to find subdomains of a given domain using open-source tools or APIs.
- **Broken Links Check**: Automatically find and report broken internal and external links across a site.
- **Advanced Directory Traversal**: Enhance directory scanning to include custom directory wordlists and advanced traversal techniques.
- **Content Injection Testing**: Add functionality to test for content injection vulnerabilities (HTML, JS, etc.).
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Testing**: Detect and exploit CSRF vulnerabilities on web applications.
- **Credential Stuffing Attack Simulation**: Add the capability to simulate credential stuffing attacks using leaked databases of usernames and passwords.
- **Bruteforce SSH and FTP Services**: Implement brute force attack techniques to test SSH and FTP services running on the target.
- **API Security Testing**: Add API security tests including rate limiting, authentication mechanisms, and more.
- **Automated Reports Generation**: Allow the tool to generate detailed penetration testing reports automatically with a summary and the full test results.
- **More Vulnerability Tests**: Continue adding tests for other common vulnerabilities like **Command Injection**, **LDAP Injection**, **File Inclusion**, etc.
- **Enhanced Logging and Alerting**: Add more comprehensive logging and alerts for the progress and completion of tests.
- **Target Range Scanning**: Ability to scan a range of IPs/domains instead of a single target.
- **Real-time Progress Monitoring**: Include a visual progress bar or live output on the GUI for real-time monitoring of ongoing tests.

    cd Web-Pentester
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    Alternatively, manually install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

### Running the Tool

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
    ```bash
    python pentester.py
    ```

2. The GUI window will appear. Enter the target URL and select the tests you want to run.
3. Click **Start Testing** to begin the penetration tests.
4. After the tests are completed, you can click **Export Results** to save the output to a text file.

## Usage

### Main Functions:
- **Target URL**: Enter the URL of the web application you want to test.
- **Test Selection**: Select the tests you want to perform from the available options.
- **Log Output**: The results of the tests are displayed in the log output box.
- **Export Results**: Save the testing results to a file.

### Supported Tests:
- **SSL/TLS Check**: Validates if SSL/TLS is properly configured on the web server.
- **Security Headers Check**: Ensures important security headers are present.
- **Open Ports Scan**: Scans for common open ports on the server.
- **Directory Scanning**: Checks for common files like `.git`, `.env`, `sitemap.xml`, and more.
- **XSS Testing**: Injects XSS payloads to test for vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Injection Testing**: Injects SQL payloads to test for vulnerabilities.
- **Broken Authentication Testing**: Tries common username/password combinations to test authentication mechanisms.
